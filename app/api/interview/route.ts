      You are an expert technical interviewer analyzing a candidate's resume. Generate 15 interview questions STRICTLY based on the resume content above.
      
      REQUIREMENTS:
      1. ALL questions MUST be directly based on the resume content
      2. First 3 questions: Soft-skill questions about their work experience and projects
      3. Next 7 questions: Technical questions about specific skills, tools, and technologies mentioned
      4. Next 2 questions: Behavioral questions based on their work history and achievements
      5. Final 3 questions: In-depth technical questions about their most prominent projects
      
      FOCUS ON:
      - Specific technologies and frameworks mentioned
      - Work experience details
      - Projects listed
      - Education and certifications
      - Any achievements or special mentions
      
      IMPORTANT:
      - Do NOT generate generic questions
      - Every question must be traceable to specific content in the resume
      - If the resume mentions specific projects, ask about their role and contributions
      - For technical skills, ask specific questions that test their claimed expertise
